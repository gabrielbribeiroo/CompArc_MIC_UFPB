# Computer Architecture 2 - Microarchitecture

## Abstract
This repository contains some exercises from the Computer Architecture 2 discipline to be performed in MIC-1.

## Goals
- **Understanding instruction execution**: Explore how high-level programming languages are translated into low-level machine instructions, including memory management, register allocation and instruction pipelines.
- **Performance optimization techniques**: Learn how low-level optimizations, such as instruction scheduling, register usage, and cache-aware programming, can improve execution speed and efficiency.

## Tools
- **MIC-1**: A low-level microprogramming language used to define and simulate microarchitectures, based on Andrew Tanenbaum's model from *Structured Computer Organization*.
