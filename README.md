# Computer Architecture 2 - Microarchitecture

## Abstract
This repository contains some Computer Architecture 2 discipline exercises to be performed in Assembly (MIC-1) language.

## Goals
- **Understanding instruction execution**: Explore how high-level programming languages are translated into low-level machine instructions, including memory management, register allocation and instruction pipelines.
- **Performance optimization techniques**: Learn how low-level optimizations, such as instruction scheduling, register usage, and cache-aware programming, can improve execution speed and efficiency.
- **Implementing XOR, its negation, and multiplication in MIC1**: Develop and optimize the XOR (exclusive OR) operation, logical negation (~XOR), and multiplication using microinstructions in the MIC1 architecture.

## Tools
- **MIC-1**: A low-level microprogramming language used to define and simulate microarchitectures, based on Andrew Tanenbaum's model from *Structured Computer Organization*.
